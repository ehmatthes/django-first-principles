Django from first principles
---

This is the project featured in the [Django from first principles](https://www.mostlypython.com/django-from-first-principles/) series on [Mostly Python](https://www.mostlypython.com).

Most Django tutorials and resources use the standard approach of beginning a new project with `django-admin startproject`, followed by `manage.py startapp`. For experienced Django developers, this is a good approach. For people new to web development however, it creates a lot of complexity right at the start of the project. The *Django from first principles* series builds a simple but nontrivial project, starting with a single file.
